//! Making floating-point behave: ordering, equivalence, hashing, and
//! constraints for floating-point types.
//!
//! Decorum provides traits that describe types using floating-point
//! representations and provides proxy types that wrap primitive floating-point
//! types. Proxy types implement a total ordering and constraints on the classes
//! of values that they may represent.
//!
//! # Floating-Point Classes
//!
//! Traits, proxy types, and constraints are based on three classes or subsets
//! of floating-point values:
//!
//! | Class        | Trait      |
//! |--------------|------------|
//! | real number  | `Real`     |
//! | infinity     | `Infinite` |
//! | not-a-number | `Nan`      |
//!
//! Primitive floating-point values directly expose IEEE-754 and therefore the
//! complete set of values (and traits). Proxy types implement traits that are
//! compatible with their constraints, so types that disallow `NaN`s do not
//! implement the `Nan` trait, for example.
//!
//! # Proxy Types
//!
//! Proxy types wrap primitive floating-point types and constrain the classes of
//! values that they can represent:
//!
//! | Type     | Aliases      | Trait Implementations                      | Disallowed Values     |
//! |----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
//! | `Total`  |              | `Encoding + Real + Infinite + Nan + Float` |                       |
//! | `NotNan` | `N32`, `N64` | `Encoding + Real + Infinite`               | `NaN`                 |
//! | `Finite` | `R32`, `R64` | `Encoding + Real`                          | `NaN`, `-INF`, `+INF` |
//!
//! The `NotNan` and `Finite` types disallow values that represent `NaN`,
//! $\infin$, and $-\infin$. **Operations that emit values that violate these
//! constraints will panic**. The `Total` type applies no constraints and
//! exposes all classes of floating-point values.
//!
//! # Total Ordering
//!
//! The following total ordering is implemented by all proxy types and is
//! provided by traits in the `cmp` module:
//!
//! $$-\infin<\cdots<0<\cdots<\infin<\text{NaN}$$
//!
//! Note that all zero and `NaN` representations are considered equivalent. See
//! the `cmp` module documentation for more details.
//!
//! # Equivalence
//!
//! Floating-point `NaN`s have numerous representations and are incomparable.
//! Decorum considers all `NaN` representations equal to all other `NaN`
//! representations and any and all `NaN` representations are unequal to
//! non-`NaN` values.
//!
//! See the `cmp` module documentation for more details.
